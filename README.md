# A350-Family 

Authors: im_frustrated45 (me) and asta16

Airbus A350 Family for Flightgear Flight Simulator. 
This is a new repository which is based of the sglichrist a350 family. (https://github.com/sgilchrist123/A350-family)

This in turn is based of the vezza a350 which I can not see. I am assuming that vezza's a350 is based off the legecy a350XWB by FGMEMBERS. (https://github.com/FGMEMBERS/A350XWB)

Credits for the legecy a350XWB go to vezza, Octal450 (Josh), IAHM-COL, Sbyx13, legoboyvdlp, RenanMsV, godarklight, JWocky, juse1235 and others. If your name is not included in this list, I offer you my sincere apologies.
